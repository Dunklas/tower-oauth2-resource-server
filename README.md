# tower-oauth2-resource-server

Tower middleware that provides JWT authorization against an OpenID Connect (OIDC) Provider.

Main inspiration for this middleware (both in naming and functionality) is [OAuth 2.0 Resource Server](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/resource-server/index.html).
